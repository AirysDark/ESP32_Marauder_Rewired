# ESP32 Marauder Rewired ‚Äî v1.0.0

## Overview
This is the official **v1.0.0** release of ESP32 Marauder Rewired.  
It marks the point where we‚Äôve stabilized the build process and introduced flexible workflows for both **Premade Build Mode** and **Custom Build Mode**.

## Build Modes

### üîπ Premade Build Mode
Choose from a list of preconfigured board profiles (via `manifest.json`).  
- Automatically sets up filesystem, partition, and profile settings.  
- Ready to compile with a single click in GitHub Actions.  

### üîπ Custom Build Mode
For advanced users.  
- Select exactly which modules to include (WiFi, BLE, Web, SD, GPS, Touch, LVGL, NeoPixel, Buzzer, Buttons, Battery, NRF24, USB MSC, TFT).  
- Supports manual entry of CSV module lists in the workflow dispatch menu.  
- Upcoming support for **Custom Pin Menu** to remap hardware pins.

## Development Journey

We began by attempting to use the original ESP32 Marauder source, but faced numerous issues in building and porting it into a clean workflow.  
Through trial and error, we stripped down and rebuilt the workflow system from scratch ‚Äî focusing on modularity, manifest-driven board detection, and compatibility with multiple ESP32 cores.

### Advantages of this Build
- Manifest-driven board resolution (`manifest.json`)  
- Custom partitions with pretty names for ease of selection  
- Build system works across **Premade** and **Custom** modes  
- Automatic TFT header configuration based on board profile  
- Unified `marauder_default.csv` partition for consistency  

### What‚Äôs Working
- ‚úÖ Multiple ESP32 boards supported  
- ‚úÖ TFT auto-configuration for supported boards  
- ‚úÖ Partition CSV selection (with pretty dropdown names)  
- ‚úÖ Premade/Custom build modes fully functional  
- ‚úÖ Firmware artifacts uploaded automatically  

### What‚Äôs Missing / Coming Soon
- ‚è≥ Custom Pin Menu for remapping hardware pins  
- ‚è≥ Additional advanced profiles and presets  
- ‚è≥ Expanded TFT header support for more displays  
- ‚è≥ CI validation of all partitions before release

## Versioning
We‚Äôre starting here with **v1.0.0** as the first **official stable release**.  
Future releases will follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
